# Hacktoberfest Narrative

This is a series of pull-requests that describe the fall of Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest. It's meant to be read as a series of diffs to highlight the changes over time.

While it's clearly a ploy to boost my PR count this year, it's meant to be taken as art and, therefore, has legitimate value.

(Besides, none of the actually-legitimate PRs I made this year will have enough maintainer attention to be accepted by the deadline, and I'm not going to nag them about it.)
