# Shitoberfest

Shitoberfest is a great way for T-shirt seekers to spam Open-Source maintainers of popular projects. Participants who make four self-approved pull requests win a shameful T-shirt ad from Digital Ocean (or make them plant a tree) at the expense of the community's time and attention, while those who make useful PRs don't get approved in time and get nothing. Quantity is annoying, quality is low.
